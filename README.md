> This is a very early work in progress, I would recommend investing time in other workshops like https://github.com/awslabs/amazon-sagemaker-examples, https://sagemaker-workshop.com/, https://www.sagemakerworkshop.com/, and https://www.getstartedonsagemaker.com/

A Hugo based site on how to build production ready machine learning solutions on AWS.
